# TODO

- explicitly mention any/all magic
- figure out magic defaults for chunking (i.e. if chunk_size is None, do we pick 1, or pick based on if it's in frame?)
- fix storage_order api (name "ngff" is too specific, and has a TODO)
- dtype string needs to be validated
- compression needs to be passed through
