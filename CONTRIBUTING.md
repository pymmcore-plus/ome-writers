# Contributing to ome-writers

We welcome contributions to ome-writers!

## Scope of the project

To give you a general sense for whats "in-scope" for this project:

`ome-writers` aims to provide a consistent API for *writing* data as it streams
from acquisition hardware, or is processed in memory, to standardized bioimaging
formats, specifically OME-TIFF and OME-Zarr.

The actual writing of data is delegated to backend implementations, such as
(currently) `tifffile` for OME-TIFF and `tensorstore` or `acquire-zarr` for
OME-Zarr. `ome-writers` provides a common interface to these backends, and the
goal is for the user to be able to switch between backends while retaining the
same high-level API, which is roughly:

```python
import ome_writers as omew

with omew.create_stream(..., backend='some-backend') as stream:
    for frame in acquisition:
        stream.append(frame)
```

Anything that falls within this scope is welcome, including, but not limited to:

- New backends for writing OME-TIFF or OME-Zarr
- Performance improvements to existing backends
- Extended support for functionality provided by one or more backend
- Extended support for metadata, e.g. OME-XML, NGFF metadata

> [!TIP] In any API abstraction, the question arises of "how much to abstract",
> and whether we aim to cover the union or the intersection of functionality
> provided by the backends.  We don't have a strict policy on this, but we *do*
> want to be able to take advantage of unique features of a given backend, so
> backend-specific options will likely be considered.

## Dependency policy

We want to keep the core of `ome-writers` as lightweight as possible, but each
backend may have its own dependencies, which are declared under the
corresponding "extra" in the `[project.optional-dependencies]` table in
`pyproject.toml`.

> [!TIP]
> Though it is in the `pymmcore-plus` organization, `ome-writers` does *not*
> depend on `pymmcore-plus` or make any assumptions about where the data is
> coming from.  (`pymmcore-plus` may be a consumer of `ome-writers`, but
> `ome-writers` is not dependent on `pymmcore-plus`).

## Development

While not mandatory, we generally use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage
environments and dependencies, and instructions below assume you are using `uv`.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/pymmcore-plus/ome-writers

# setup dev environment, with ome-writers installed in editable mode
uv sync
```

### Testing

```sh
uv run pytest
```

If you want to test *exactly* the dependencies for a specific extra,
you can use:

```sh
uv run --exact --only-group <backend> pytest
```

where `<backend>` is one of `tensorstore`, `acquire-zarr`, or `tifffile`
(or any future added backend.)

### Pre-commit (linting and formatting)

```sh
uv run pre-commit run -a

# or, to install the git hooks
uv run pre-commit install
```
